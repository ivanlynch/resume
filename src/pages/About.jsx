      <Title size={Size.H2}>How it started</Title>
      <Text>
        I was always curious about practically everything. It started as a kid
        disassembling things and trying to create new ones. At the age of 8 I
        moved the focus to my first computer, which I broke many times just
        trying to improve. As a teenager, I started learning basic programming
        skills. Closely to the 20's i got my firsts small jobs as a developer
        and at the age of 23 finally got my first experience in a startup where
        I was so excited to learn more and work with experienced people.

        Years later, after working on many projects without focusing on a role
        and doing a lot of things, i was a bit lost on what to do, then decided
        to take a breath and focus on what i really enjoy to do then{" "}

      <Text>
        In 2018 i traveled to Sao Paulo, Brazil, for a project where it was a
        life changer for me. I meet my wife, I learned a new language, I got a
        job where i meet amazing people and I started to learn a lot about his
        culture. At the begining of 2020 I moved to Brazil to start a new life
        with my wife.
